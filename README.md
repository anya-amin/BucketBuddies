# BucketBuddies
BucketBuddies is an online platform created to find people to complete your bucket list items with. 

In this demo, it is showing how the user can create an account, verify that email and update their profile. Now to add items to their bucket list, the user can either tap on the recommended suggestions or type in whichever they want. Later, if they want to match to people, they can go to that tab and users with similar or the same items will appear. And therefore, they can match and reach out to each other to complete these items.
